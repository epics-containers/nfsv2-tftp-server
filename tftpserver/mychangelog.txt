Removed references to outside github, removed require line from go.mod
instead of downloading pack.ag/tftp we are directly importing tftpserver/go-tftp into
main.go. Also for conn.go had to change an import line from pack.ag/tftp/netascii or something like that.

Doing all this to allow myself to make local changes so I can create a logging file.
